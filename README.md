 An android application talks to cloud mqtt server to receives published data from arduino.
 
The main idea behind developing this project was to alert the owner of bag by vibrating the phone and giving the current location of bag. The bag consits of a system which has arduino uno board, GPS and a GSM808 module which sends/publishes data(GPS coordinates) to cloud mqtt
server to android application. Further processing will be done in application which includes displaying current distance of bag from phone, locating current position of bag on Google Maps.
